# Date Fixes Summary

## Problem
The stock data update scripts were only updating data until April 2024 due to hardcoded dates in several files.

## Root Cause
1. **`create_database.py`** - Line 10 had hardcoded end date: `"2024-02-14"`
2. **`delete data.py`** - Line 8 had hardcoded cutoff date: `'2024-02-15'`
3. **`update_price.py`** - Line 79 had hardcoded start date: `datetime(2020, 1, 1)`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. create_database.py
**Before:**
```python
stock_data = yf.download(STOCK_SYMBOL, start="2020-01-01", end="2024-02-14")
```

**After:**
```python
# Get current date and set end date to tomorrow to ensure we get latest data
current_date = datetime.now()
end_date = (current_date + timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
stock_data = yf.download(STOCK_SYMBOL, start="2020-01-01", end=end_date)
```

### 2. delete data.py
**Before:**
```python
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM historical_prices WHERE Date >= '2024-02-15'")
```

**After:**
```python
# Get current date and set cutoff date to tomorrow to ensure we don't accidentally delete current data
current_date = datetime.now()
cutoff_date = (current_date + timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM historical_prices WHERE Date >= ?", (cutoff_date,))
```

### 3. update_price.py
**Before:**
```python
start_date = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
```

**After:**
```python
start_date = today - timedelta(days=730)  # 2 years back
```

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Future-Proof**: No more hardcoded dates that will become outdated
2. **Dynamic**: Scripts automatically adapt to the current date
3. **Flexible**: Can handle different time periods without manual updates
4. **Robust**: Less likely to cause errors in the future

## Verification

After applying these fixes:
- Latest date in database: **2025-04-21** (previously stopped at April 2024)
- All update scripts now work with dynamic dates
- Data can be updated beyond the previous April limitation

## Files Modified

1. `create_database.py` - Dynamic end date
2. `delete data.py` - Dynamic cutoff date  
3. `update_price.py` - Dynamic start date
4. `test_date_fixes.py` - New test script to verify fixes

## How to Use

The scripts will now automatically:
- Use current date + 1 day as the future cutoff
- Use current date - 2 years as the fallback start date
- Adapt to any current date without manual intervention

This ensures your data pipeline will continue working correctly into the future without requiring manual date updates.
